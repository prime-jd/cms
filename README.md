## Nodemon

Nodemon is a utility tool for Node.js applications that monitors changes in your source code files and automatically restarts the server whenever a change is detected. It's particularly useful during the development phase of a Node.js application, as it eliminates the need to manually stop and restart the server every time you make changes to your code.
```
npm i -D nodemon  // dev dependencies
